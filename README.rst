MXDC
====
MxDC (Macromolecular Crystallography Data Collector) is a software package for acquisition of
data from Macromolecular Crystallography and related experiments at synchrotron beamlines. MxDC has
been developed since 2006 and is been the primary software for data acquisition and experiment
control at the Canadian Light Source Macromolecular Crystallography beamlines.  

    An earlier version of MxDC is described in the following publication:

    * MxDC and MxLIVE: software for data acquisition, information management and
      remote access to macromolecular crystallography beamlines. M. Fodje, K. Janzen,
      R. Berg, G. Black, S. Labiuk, J. Gorin and P. Grochulski
      J. Synchrotron Rad. (2012). 19, 274-280. https://doi.org/10.1107/S0909049511056305


Although developed primarily for MX beamlines, MxDC is based on an extensible generic framework that can be used
to develop data acquisition systems for different types of experiments and beamlines.
