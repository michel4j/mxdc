The growing impact of macromolecular structural analysis to pharmaceutical, academic and industrial research has resulted in a growing demand for access to protein crystallography beamlines.  This demand is reflected not only in the number of samples available for analysis, but also the number of scientists of different fields now using structural information in their research. There is therefore a need to provide a user-friendly high throughput beamline to cater for the needs of the growing community of users of structural information in Canada. 

The CMCF 08B1 beamline is sourced from the first bending magnet in sector 08. The aim is to create a beamline which provides for the highest level of automation, performance and ease-of-use for high-throughput structure determination by both expert and non-expert users. A fully automated beamline requires automation of all aspects of the experiment with only very minimal or no human intervention:

* Automatic alignment and configuration of the beamline hardware

* Automatic setup of the experiment, i.e. automatic mounting and centering of crystals in the X-ray beam, after they have been shipped at liquid nitrogen temperature from the user’s home laboratory. This requires automatic adjustment of crystal viewing conditions such illumination, contrast, as well as image analysis.

* Automatic measurement of a fluorescence spectrum for MAD experiments

* Initial analysis of crystals in order to assess crystal quality and determine optimum parameters and strategies for data collection.

* Automatic data collection and data processing.

All of the beamline and end-station instrumentation should be controlled by an integrated control environment with a user-friendly, secure interface. The integrated control environment or beamline expert system,  will allow remote management of the experiment from the user’s home lab and be intelligent enough to be capable of replacing user input with sensible parameters for data collection if desired.
