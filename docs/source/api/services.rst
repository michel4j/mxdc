Services
========

Services in MxDC are objects that allow MxDC to connect to external servers, and websites that do not behave like
traditional devices.  If you need a client which connects to a LIMS system to fetch or push meta-data, a Service is
the proper mechanism of doing that. Like Devices and Engines, Services can also declare and use signals.
